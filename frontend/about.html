            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>My journey to create Illumina began during a pivotal moment in my life. As a career-changer pursuing a Master's in Computer Science without prior background in the field, I found myself navigating not just the challenges of a new professional path, but also the complex decision of when to start a family. When I became pregnant during my studies, I desperately searched for someone who had walked a similar path â€“ someone who could understand the unique intersection of career transition, academic pursuits, and impending motherhood. The questions were endless: How would pregnancy affect my studies? When should I tell potential employers? How could I plan my career trajectory while embracing motherhood? The absence of a dedicated space for such conversations led to the birth of Illumina. Here, we believe that women shouldn't have to choose between their career ambitions and motherhood. Whether you're contemplating when to have children, currently pregnant, on maternity leave, or returning to work after a career break, Illumina connects you with mentors who have navigated similar journeys. Our mentors share their experiences, strategies, and insights, creating a supportive network where professional women can find guidance through every stage of motherhood. Together, we're illuminating paths forward not just for ourselves, but for generations to come.</p>
